# Degreed Pathway Hands-On

## The purpose:
The purpose of this Hands-on is that you can practice some concepts studied during the Pathway. Some themes that we will exercise here are:
- Classes;
- Import and export of files;
- Configuration files;
- Const x Let;
- Environment variables;
- Native functions of NodeJS;

## Suggestion:
Create a basic system for tracking students and their averages. Given an input file, containing the students and their averages in certain subjects, we have to calculate which of these students passed the subject, with the passing average being greater than 5.

In this case we could have the students described as a class, which contains methods of averaging, for example. An input file with student information and another with environment variables that might be useful.

Try to exercise this idea by creating the project and starting class. Trying to create your first students with just the class. Then, it can evolve and better separate the responsibilities.

To help you on this journey, we have prepared a support project, like a kind of playground. The most important idea is to have a space for you to exercise the concepts learned during the pathway.

## How to run the demo project:
To run it, you should install all the dependencies and type in your terminal:
```
 node src/main.js english
```
